# why do I create this repository?
I am focusing on the robotics navigation problem with reinforcement learning methods. All the time people consider SLAM methods as the kernel solution for navigation purpose of robot. However, SLAM method has a few difficulty parts that are not well solved for a long time. I'm considering and trying to find a distinctive way, with the help of deep reinforcement learning method, to see if there are any improvement in robotics navigation.

# what is in this repository?
Currently, I am writting the code based on the paper ["Navigation intersactions with Autonomous vehicles using Deep Reinforcement Learning"](http://xueshu.baidu.com/s?wd=paperuri%3A%288096d7729767e358d7308ee6a1bb902d%29&filter=sc_long_sign&tn=SE_xueshusource_2kduw22v&sc_vurl=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1705.01196&ie=utf-8&sc_us=17616306211134359942). This paper provided an efficient strategy to navigate safety through unsignaled intersactions.

+ **basic**:
  Mainly include the elementary parts of a 'SUMO' map
